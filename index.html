            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Kaitlyn Nobiss is an indigenous graphic designer and multidisciplinary artist whose creative practice spans digital illustration,acrylic painting,public art and storytelling. Her work is authentic expression that explores her relationship to her indigenous identity,emotions and exploration of diverse art styles. In 2021 her journey began when she participated in her first community art show. The Ivviulutit art show waas an opportunity for Nunavummiut youth to come together and use art to strike conversations around LGTBQIA2S+ expression. By the end of the night her water colour painting "Indigenous Savage" was sold and her path was set to continuing to define what being an artist meant to her.</p> 
            <p>As an artist she seeks out community and spaces where she can connect with others. In 2022 she created a piece " Shush " for STEPS Public Art forum " Create Space ". Within the forum she explored new approaches to creating work for public spaces paired with social justice advocacy. With N'we Jinan in 2024 she completd a National online artist skills development program.For the program she created "Four Medicines" . Her acrylic paintings for "Four Medicines' solidified her appreciation for acrylic painting and it was later sold to Selkirk College, Nelson, B.C to be placed at their Silver King Campus.Through her growing body of work, she continues to explore what it means to create from a place of in-betweenâ€”blending design, emotion, and identity to make space for voices like her own.</p>
