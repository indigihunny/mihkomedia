            <div class="about">
                <p class="bio">Kaitlyn Nobiss is an <strong><em>indigenous graphic designer and multidisciplinary artist</em></strong> whose creative practice spans digital illustration,acrylic painting,public art and storytelling. Her work serves as an authetnic expression of her relationship to her identity,her emotions and her exploration of diverse artistic styles. 
                <p class="bio">Her journey as an artist began in 2021 when she participated in her first community exhibition-<strong>Ivviulutit art show</strong>-a space for Nunavummiut youth to spark conversations around LGTBQIA2S+ expression through art.That evening her watercolour painting <em>"Indigenous Savage"</em> was sold affiriming her path forward and shaping her understanding of what it means to be an artist.</p> 
                <p class="bio">Kaitlyn acitvely seeks opportunities to connect with community through her work. In 2022, she created <em>"Shush"</em> for the <strong>STEPS Public Art's CreateSpace</strong> forum, where she explored new approaches to public art while integrating elements of social justice advocacy. In 2024, she completed <strong>N'we Jinan's</strong> national online artist skills development program, producing <em>"Four Medicines"</em>-a series of acrylic paintings that deepened her connection to the medium. The work was later acquired by <strong>Selkirk College</strong> in Nelson, B.C for permanent display at its Silver King Campus. 
                <p class="bio">In 2025, Kaitlyn graduated with honours from Selkirk College's Digital Arts program further solidifying her foundation as both a designer and artist.Through her growing body of work Kaitlyn continues to explore the spaces of in-between, where design,emotion and identity meet-to create meaningful art that amplfies voices like her own.</p> 
                <p class="bio">Kaitlyn is a reconnecting Indigenous person whose biological father, a product of the Sixties Scoop, is a non-status First Nations person. She spent her early years in foster care before being adopted at age eight by her adopted parents. Her adopted parents are Saulteaux-Cree and Anishinaabe mixed with European lineage.They are members of the Manitoba MÃ©tis Federation. Kaitlyn is actively researching her paternal lineage, which connects to Treaty 6 territory and Beaver Lake Cree Nation, with hopes of one day meeting her community.</p>
