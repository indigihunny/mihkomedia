        <h3>Acrylic | Four canvases | 16" by 24"</h3>
            <p>Growing up, Kaitlyn was taught about the four sacred medicines: Cedar, Tobacco, Sage, and Sweetgrass. Her mother would prepare cedar water, valued for its medicinal properties. She learned that tobacco is offered to the land and to the Creator, both as a way to send prayers and to give thanks for the gifts harvested from the earth. Sweetgrass braids were often present throughout the home, and sage was regularly used for smudging.In her artwork, <em>"the Four Medicines"</em> are painted primarily in shades and tones of teal, accented with touches of redâ€”colors Kaitlyn is naturally drawn to in her creative practice. Each medicine is placed with intention, aligned with its traditional direction, and together the four canvases form one harmonious piece.</p>
